# CYOA
This is a simple choose your own adventure story. I made it while I was working in my Cyber Literacy so that I could better plan out a project.
# Installation
To install it, simply download the code and extract the Zip archive. For Linux, do the following:
`cd cyoa`
`python cyoa.py`
if python doesn't return anything check your installation and make sure you're running Python 3.5 or above. If it still doesn't work afterwards run the following:
`python3 cyoa.py`
In windows:
`python cyoa.py`
# Usage
When running the script, simply read the text and answer the prompts on screen. Make sure to use the correct capitalization and spelling as displayed in the prompts. EX:
`Would you like Eggs or Bacon? Eggs or Bacon? -` Eggs
`You eat eggs`
